Authors: Aditya Gupta (agupta42@uncc.edu) & Rekhansh Panchal (rpanchal@uncc.edu)

#### Overview:

* The project aims to analyze and extract insights from the Netflix data using the concepts of Cloud Computing.
* The goal of the project is to implement Pearson Correlation Coefficient & Alternating Least Squares algorithms with the help of PySpark.
* Movie Recommendations is implemented using Collaborative Filtering using pySpark on Netflix Data.
* This projectâ€™s primary aim is to provide movie recommendations to the user based on their
preferences.

#### What is Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative Filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from similar users.


#### Data:
The original movie rating files contain over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous Netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles. The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars. To protect customer privacy, each customer id has been replaced with a randomly-assigned id. The date of each rating and the title and year of release for each movie id are also provided.
However, use have worked on a part of the complete data for the project.
