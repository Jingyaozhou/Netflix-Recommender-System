#### Overview:

* The project aims to analyze and extract insights from the Netflix data using the concepts of Cloud Computing.
* The goal of the project is to implement Pearson Correlation Coefficient & Alternating Least Squares algorithms with the help of PySpark.
* Movie Recommendations is implemented using Collaborative Filtering using pySpark on Netflix Data.
* This project’s primary aim is to provide movie recommendations to the user based on their
preferences.

***
#### What is Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative Filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from similar users.

***

#### Data:
The original movie rating files contain over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous Netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles. 

The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars. 

However, use have worked on a part of the complete data for the project.

#### Technique:
1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient

2. Alternative Least Squares

***

#### Expectations
##### 1. What to expect?

* One ​can ​expect ​the ​implementation ​of ​both ​the ​algorithms ​and ​a ​proper documentation ​of ​outcomes ​of ​this ​project, which ​is ​the ​movie ​recommendations for ​users.

##### 2. Likely to accomplish

* Result comparison and Performance Evaluation with respect to existing implementation of algorithms and project implementation.
* Documentation and online-publishing of the codebase.

##### 3. Ideal Accomplishments.

* Suggested modifications/changes in the existing or project implementation.
* Creating a easy to use library that one can use for analysis purpose.

***

#### Tools Used:
* Jupyter Notebook
* pySpark
* Git and GitHub

***

#### Results:

***

#### Conclusion:

Created a User - User based recommendation system using ALS and Pearson Correlation Coefficient techniques.
Displayed top movies recommended a user by taking userId as input.

***

#### Future Scope:

***

#### Challenges Faced:

* We started with implementing Singular Value Decomposition technique, but couldn't achieve anything potential with that.
* Had no prior experience on implementing the code on PySpark, so had a lot of minor issues while handling the data.
* The data available is huge for to be considered, hence we had to limit it down to a lower scale.
